# Search Plus Enhanced Plugin - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

**Product Name**: Search Plus Enhanced
**Version**: 2.0.0
**Author**: shrwnsan
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED - Strategic Pivot Complete ✅
**Created**: October 13, 2025
**Revised**: October 13, 2025
**Implemented**: October 22, 2025

## Executive Summary

Search Plus Enhanced represents a strategic evolution of the existing search-plus plugin, focusing on intelligent user guidance and contextual error awareness rather than automatic tool interception. After analysis of Claude Code's hook architecture, we've pivoted from an auto-interception model to an enhanced user awareness approach that works within the platform's design constraints while providing significant user value.

## Problem Discovery & Rationale

### The Core Issue

Through analysis of the existing search-plus plugin and community feedback, we identified a critical user experience gap:

1. **Manual Intervention Required**: Users must manually invoke `/search-plus` when Claude Code's built-in search tools fail
2. **Workflow Disruption**: Search errors break the natural flow of conversation and development work
3. **Cognitive Load**: Users need to remember to switch tools when errors occur
4. **Inconsistent Experience**: Some searches succeed, others fail unpredictably

### User Research Insights

The existing search-plus plugin documentation reveals:
- Users frequently encounter 403, 429, and ECONNREFUSED errors
- These errors are well-documented and persistent across the community
- Manual fallback solutions exist but require user awareness and intervention
- The problem affects both WebSearch and WebFetch functionality

## Critical Architecture Discovery & Strategic Pivot

### Hook System Limitations Analysis

Through detailed review of Claude Code's documentation, we discovered critical architectural constraints:

#### Hook System Capabilities:
- **Pre/Post Tool Execution**: Hooks run before or after tool completion
- **Context Injection**: Provide additional context or feedback to Claude
- **Exit Code Control**: Can block tool calls (exit code 2) or provide decisions
- **Shell Command Execution**: Run arbitrary shell commands automatically

#### Hook System Limitations:
- **No Tool Replacement**: Cannot intercept and replace failed tool calls
- **No Alternative Results**: Cannot provide different results than the original tool
- **Post-Execution Only**: Cannot retry failed calls with different implementations
- **Contextual Feedback Only**: Designed for augmentation, not replacement

### Strategic Pivot: Enhanced User Awareness

Given these constraints, we pivot from **automatic interception** to **intelligent user guidance**:

#### Why This Approach Works:
1. **Architecture Aligned**: Uses hooks for their intended purpose (context and feedback)
2. **Immediate User Value**: Helps users understand and solve search problems
3. **Technical Feasibility**: Works within Claude Code's hook capabilities
4. **User Education**: Builds understanding of search limitations and solutions

#### Enhanced Features:
1. **Error Detection**: PostToolUse hooks detect search failures
2. **Smart Suggestions**: Proactively suggest `/search-plus` when errors occur
3. **Contextual Help**: Explain why errors happen and how to fix them
4. **One-Click Activation**: Easy command invocation with pre-filled parameters

### Decision: Enhance Existing Plugin

Rather than creating a separate plugin, we will enhance the existing search-plus plugin because:

1. **Simpler Architecture**: Single plugin instead of maintaining two
2. **Clear User Experience**: One enhanced search command
3. **Better Discovery**: Users learn about enhanced search when they need it
4. **Natural Evolution**: Enhancing existing functionality vs. duplication
5. **Lower Maintenance**: One codebase to maintain and improve

## Revised Product Requirements
