# Problem Statement

We're still getting errors such as these:

Error: Agent type 'search-plus' not found. Available agents: general-purpose, statusline-setup, output-style-setup, Explore, search-plus:search-plus, debugger, docs-architect, code-reviewer

We want to look into the naming or path that is within the search-plus plugin for calling agent search-plus
