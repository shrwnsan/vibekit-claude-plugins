# PRD: Improve Search Plus Agent Discoverability

## Overview

Investigation and resolution of agent naming/discovery issues for the search-plus plugin, ensuring users can successfully invoke the search-plus agent without naming conflicts.

## Problem Statement

### Original Issue
Users were encountering agent discovery errors:

```
Error: Agent type 'search-plus' not found. Available agents: general-purpose, statusline-setup, output-style-setup, Explore, search-plus:search-plus, debugger, docs-architect, code-reviewer
```

### Root Cause Analysis
The error revealed that agents are registered with namespace prefixes (e.g., `search-plus:search-plus`) rather than simple names, which caused confusion for users expecting to invoke agents by their simple names.

## Investigation Results

### ✅ Agent Registration Confirmed
- **Namespace Behavior**: Agent registration follows pattern `{plugin-name}:{agent-name}`
- **Expected Behavior**: `search-plus:search-plus` is the correct agent identifier
- **User Experience**: Users need to be educated on proper agent invocation syntax

### ✅ Documentation Gap Identified
- **Current Documentation**: Lacked clear guidance on agent invocation
- **User Expectation**: Users expected simple agent names vs namespace-prefixed names
- **Resolution Needed**: Update documentation with correct agent invocation examples

## Resolution Implemented

### 1. Documentation Updates
- **Agent Invocation**: Updated examples to show `search-plus:search-plus` usage
- **User Guidance**: Added troubleshooting section for agent discovery
- **Examples**: Provided clear invocation patterns for all plugin components

### 2. User Education
- **Three-Mode Model**: Clarified Command (`/search-plus`), Agent (`search-plus:search-plus`), and Skill (auto-discovery) usage
- **Discovery Methods**: Documented different ways to access plugin functionality
- **Troubleshooting**: Added guidance for common agent discovery issues

### 3. Validation Testing
- **Agent Access**: Verified `search-plus:search-plus` agent is discoverable and functional
- **Integration Testing**: Confirmed agent works within Claude Code's agent system
- **User Workflows**: Tested end-to-end agent invocation and functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

### ✅ COMPLETED

- **AC1**: ✅ Root cause of agent naming issue identified and documented
- **AC2**: ✅ Documentation updated with correct agent invocation syntax
- **AC3**: ✅ User guidance provided for agent discovery and troubleshooting
- **AC4**: ✅ Agent functionality validated through testing
- **AC5**: ✅ Three-mode model documentation clarified for users

## Implementation Results

### Agent Discovery Status
- **Agent Name**: `search-plus:search-plus` (correct namespace behavior)
- **Accessibility**: Agent is discoverable and functional
- **User Guidance**: Clear documentation provided for proper invocation

### Documentation Improvements
- **Invocation Examples**: Added `search-plus:search-plus` usage patterns
- **Troubleshooting**: Common agent discovery issues documented
- **User Education**: Three-mode model explained with clear examples

### User Experience Validation
- **Agent Access**: Users can successfully invoke the agent with proper syntax
- **Error Prevention**: Clear guidance prevents naming confusion
- **Workflow Integration**: Agent works seamlessly within Claude Code

## Conclusion

The agent discoverability issue has been resolved through documentation updates and user education. The `search-plus:search-plus` namespace behavior is correct and expected within Claude Code's plugin system. Users now have clear guidance on proper agent invocation and troubleshooting.
