# PRD: Self-Referential Testing and Skills Optimization

## Overview
Use our own search-plus plugin to solve the meta-problem of accessing Claude Skills documentation that's currently blocked by 403/429/422 errors, then apply those learnings to optimize our SKILL.md implementation.

## Goals
- Successfully access Claude Skills best practices documentation using our search-plus plugin
- Validate our plugin's effectiveness through real-world testing of problematic URLs
- Optimize our Search Plus SKILL.md based on official best practices
- Reduce verbosity while maintaining or improving auto-discovery capabilities

## Non-Goals
- Completely rewriting the SKILL.md structure (optimization only)
- Adding new functionality beyond what's already implemented
- Changing the core plugin architecture

## Problem Statement

### Primary Issue
Claude Skills best practices documentation at `https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices` is inaccessible due to the same 403/429/422 errors our plugin is designed to handle. This prevents us from optimizing our SKILL.md according to official standards.

### Secondary Issue
Our current SKILL.md implementation may be too verbose for optimal Claude auto-discovery. Without access to official best practices, we risk creating content that doesn't align with Claude's skill discovery patterns.

### Meta-Opportunity
This creates a perfect dogfooding scenario: using our own plugin to solve the exact problem it was designed to address, providing real-world validation of its capabilities.

## Key Outcomes and Success Metrics

### Access Success Metrics
- **Documentation Retrieval**: Successfully extract content from Claude Skills docs URLs (target: 100%)
- **Content Quality**: Extracted content is readable and actionable (target: 95%)

## User Stories

- As a **developer**, I want to access official Claude Skills documentation to optimize my implementation
- As a **plugin author**, I want to validate my plugin's effectiveness against real-world problematic URLs
- As a **user**, I want a concise, discoverable Skill that works reliably without manual intervention
- As a **maintainer**, I want to ensure my Skill follows official best practices for maximum compatibility

## Scope

### In Scope
- Testing search-plus plugin against Claude documentation URLs
- Extracting and analyzing Claude Skills best practices
- Optimizing existing SKILL.md based on official guidance
- Validating all three invocation modes (Skill/Command/Agent)
- Documenting the dogfooding process and results

### Out of Scope

- Completely restructuring the plugin architecture
- Creating new documentation from scratch without official guidance
- Modifying core hook-based functionality

## Testing Methodology

### Phase 1: Baseline Testing
**Target URLs:**
- Primary: `https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices`
- Secondary: `https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#skill-structure`

**Test Approaches:**
1. **Skill Auto-Discovery**: "Extract content from Claude Skills best practices documentation"
2. **Command Explicit**: `/search-plus "https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices"`
3. **Agent Delegated**: "Use search-plus agent to comprehensively extract Claude Skills documentation"

**Success Criteria:**
- Content successfully extracted and readable
- Error recovery mechanisms demonstrated
- Performance metrics collected

### Phase 2: Content Analysis
**Analysis Focus:**
- Official skill structure requirements
- Best practices for content length and verbosity
- Recommended frontmatter fields and formats
- Discovery optimization techniques
- User experience guidelines

### Phase 3: Optimization Implementation
**Optimization Areas:**
- Frontmatter refinement based on official specs
- Content structure reorganization
- Example improvement and simplification
- Discovery keyword optimization
- User guidance enhancement

### Phase 4: Validation Testing
**Testing Approach:**
- Compare pre/post optimization performance
- Validate auto-discovery improvements
- Test with various user scenarios
- Ensure no functionality regression

## Technical Requirements

### Plugin Testing Requirements
1. **Multi-Mode Validation**: Test Skill, Command, and Agent invocation
2. **Error Recovery Logging**: Document all error handling and recovery attempts
3. **Performance Measurement**: Track response times and success rates
4. **Content Quality Assessment**: Evaluate extracted content readability and completeness

### SKILL.md Optimization Requirements
1. **Frontmatter Compliance**: Align with official skill structure standards
2. **Content Conciseness**: Reduce verbosity while maintaining clarity
3. **Discovery Optimization**: Improve auto-discovery trigger phrases
4. **User Experience**: Maintain clear usage guidance and troubleshooting

### Documentation Requirements
1. **Process Documentation**: Record the dogfooding approach and results
2. **Comparison Analysis**: Document before/after optimization differences
3. **Lessons Learned**: Capture insights about plugin effectiveness and limitations

## Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: Successfully extract content from at least one Claude Skills documentation URL
- AC2: Demonstrate error recovery capabilities on blocked Claude documentation
- AC3: Identify specific actionable optimizations for SKILL.md based on official guidance
- AC4: Reduce SKILL.md verbosity by 30-50% while maintaining functionality
- AC5: Validate all three plugin invocation modes work against Claude docs URLs
- AC6: Document the complete testing and optimization process
- AC7: Maintain backward compatibility and functionality

## Risk Analysis and Mitigations

### High Risk: Documentation Access Fails
**Risk**: Our plugin cannot access Claude documentation despite being designed for this scenario
**Mitigation**:
- Document the failure as valuable feedback for plugin improvement
- Seek alternative approaches to obtain best practices
- Use the attempt as validation of plugin limitations

### Medium Risk: Official Guidance Conflicts with Current Implementation
**Risk**: Official best practices require significant restructuring of our SKILL.md
**Mitigation**:
- Implement changes incrementally with testing at each step
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Document trade-offs and decisions

### Low Risk: Optimization Reduces Functionality
**Risk**: Over-optimization makes the Skill less discoverable or functional
**Mitigation**:
- Test each optimization individually
- Maintain core functionality while improving presentation
- Have rollback plan for each change

## Implementation Timeline
