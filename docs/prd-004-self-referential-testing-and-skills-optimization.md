# PRD: Self-Referential Testing and Skills Optimization

## Overview
Use our own search-plus plugin to solve the meta-problem of accessing Claude Skills documentation that's currently blocked by 403/429/422 errors, then apply those learnings to optimize our SKILL.md implementation.

## Goals
- Successfully access Claude Skills best practices documentation using our search-plus plugin
- Validate our plugin's effectiveness through real-world testing of problematic URLs
- Optimize our Search Plus SKILL.md based on official best practices
- Reduce verbosity while maintaining or improving auto-discovery capabilities

## Non-Goals
- Completely rewriting the SKILL.md structure (optimization only)
- Adding new functionality beyond what's already implemented
- Changing the core plugin architecture

## Problem Statement

### Primary Issue
Claude Skills best practices documentation at `https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices` is inaccessible due to the same 403/429/422 errors our plugin is designed to handle. This prevents us from optimizing our SKILL.md according to official standards.

### Secondary Issue
Our current SKILL.md implementation may be too verbose for optimal Claude auto-discovery. Without access to official best practices, we risk creating content that doesn't align with Claude's skill discovery patterns.

### Meta-Opportunity
This creates a perfect dogfooding scenario: using our own plugin to solve the exact problem it was designed to address, providing real-world validation of its capabilities.

## Risk Analysis and Mitigations

### High Risk: Documentation Access Fails ‚úÖ MITIGATED
**Risk**: Our plugin cannot access Claude documentation despite being designed for this scenario
**Outcome**: **SUCCESS** - Skill mode achieved 100% success with comprehensive content extraction
**Actual Result**: Plugin successfully extracted detailed error handling guidance and best practices
**Lessons Learned**:
- Skill auto-discovery works perfectly for research context
- Command mode needs API key configuration for URL extraction
- Plugin validates its core value proposition through real-world testing

### Medium Risk: Official Guidance Conflicts with Current Implementation
**Risk**: Official best practices require significant restructuring of our SKILL.md
**Mitigation**:
- Implement changes incrementally with testing at each step
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Document trade-offs and decisions

### Low Risk: Optimization Reduces Functionality
**Risk**: Over-optimization makes the Skill less discoverable or functional
**Mitigation**:
- Test each optimization individually

## Retro Documentation: Key Learnings

### Command Output Pattern Learning (October 21, 2025)

**Initial Assumption**: Command mode was broken because it operated silently with no visible output.

**Investigation Process**:
1. Tested command execution and found it was technically functional
2. Discovered agent-delegated commands operate silently by design
3. The agent, not the command, provides the main user response
4. This is a valid architectural pattern, not a bug

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added hybrid feedback enhancement (15-25 tokens per command cost)
- Brief status messages: "üîç Extracting content..." and "‚úÖ Extraction completed"
- Maintained agent-delegated pattern while improving user experience

**Key Takeaway**:
- Silent command operation is acceptable for agent-delegated patterns
- User experience can be enhanced with minimal token cost overhead
- Understanding plugin architecture patterns prevents unnecessary debugging

**Performance Impact**:
- Token cost: +15-25 tokens per command ($0.00005-0.00008)
- User experience: Significantly improved with clear status indicators
- No impact on core functionality or agent response quality

This learning exemplifies the value of dogfooding - using our own plugin revealed architectural misunderstandings and led to meaningful UX improvements.
