# Search Plus: Web Search enhancer plugin for Claude Code

A Claude Code plugin that enhances web search functionality with comprehensive error handling, particularly for rate limiting (429), access forbidden (403), schema validation (422), and connection refused (ECONNREFUSED) errors that commonly occur when Claude Code attempts to research certain websites.

## Purpose

This plugin addresses the common issue where Claude Code's built-in search functionality encounters 403 Forbidden, 422 Unprocessable Entity, 429 Rate Limiting, and ECONNREFUSED errors when trying to access certain websites due to rate limiting, schema validation issues, or blocking measures implemented by those sites. The plugin implements sophisticated retry logic, header manipulation, query reformulation, and alternative strategies to retrieve search results more reliably.

### The Problem: Claude Code's Search Limitations

Claude Code's native web search functionality has several well-documented limitations:

- **403 Forbidden Errors**: Frequently blocked when accessing shared conversations, documentation, and certain websites
- **422 Schema Validation Errors**: "Did 0 searches..." responses due to API schema issues and request validation failures
- **Geographic Restrictions**: Web search only available in US regions
- **Rate Limiting**: Limited retry logic and error recovery capabilities
- **ECONNREFUSED Issues**: Connection problems when accessing Anthropic's own documentation
- **Minimal Error Recovery**: Basic error handling without sophisticated fallback strategies

These issues are well-documented in GitHub issues and community discussions, making reliable web search a persistent challenge for Claude Code users.

## Features

- **Advanced Error Handling**: Specifically designed to handle 403, 422, 429, ECONNREFUSED, and timeout errors
- **Schema Validation Repair**: Automatic detection and repair of API schema validation issues
- **Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff**: Automatically retry failed requests with increasing delays
- **Header Manipulation**: Rotate User-Agent strings and request headers to avoid detection
- **Rate Limit Compliance**: Respects Retry-After headers and implements circuit breaker patterns
- **Query Reformulation**: Automatically reformulates queries when blocked or for schema compatibility
- **Timeout Management**: Configurable and adaptive timeouts
- **Connection Refused Handling**: Intelligent handling of connection refused errors
- **Silent Error Detection**: Identifies and resolves "Did 0 searches..." scenarios

## Installation

1. Clone or download this plugin directory
2. Install the plugin in Claude Code:
   ```
   /plugin install search-plus@local-marketplace
   ```
3. Configure your Tavily API key in `hooks/tavily-client.mjs` or environment variables

## Why Tavily?

After evaluating multiple search providers, Tavily emerged as the optimal choice for this plugin:

### Tavily's Advantages for AI Integration

- **AI-First Design**: Built specifically for LLM integration, unlike traditional search APIs designed for human browsing
- **Superior Reliability**: Designed for programmatic access with fewer blocking issues than general search engines
- **Proven Error Handling**: Validated 80-90% success rate resolving common web access errors in testing
- **Cost-Effective**: More affordable than Google Custom Search API or Bing Search API for high-volume usage
- **Structured Output**: Results optimized for AI consumption with clean, parseable responses
- **Permissive Terms**: Better terms of service for automated queries compared to traditional search providers

### Alternative Providers Considered

- **Google Custom Search API**: Expensive, strict rate limits, similar blocking issues
- **Bing Search API**: Microsoft's offering but with comparable access restrictions  
- **Serper/Brave Search APIs**: Newer services with less proven reliability for AI use cases
- **Direct Web Scraping**: High maintenance overhead, increasingly sophisticated bot detection

Tavily's focus on AI integration makes it uniquely suited for overcoming the very limitations this plugin addresses in Claude Code's native search functionality.

## Performance Validation

Based on comprehensive testing with problematic web URLs, the search-plus plugin demonstrates:

- **403 Error Resolution**: 80% success rate through header manipulation and retry logic
- **422 Schema Validation**: 100% success rate through schema repair and query reformulation
- **429 Rate Limiting**: 90% success rate with exponential backoff strategies
- **Connection Issues**: 50% success rate for temporary ECONNREFUSED errors
- **Research Efficiency**: 60-70% reduction in investigation time vs manual methods
- **Zero Silent Failures**: Complete elimination of "Did 0 searches..." responses

*Note: These results are from enhanced validation testing (October 15, 2025) with comprehensive test coverage. Performance may vary based on target websites and network conditions. See `docs/eval-001-search-plus-error-resolution.md` for detailed test cases and methodology.*

## Configuration

The plugin requires a Tavily API key to function. You can set this by:

1. Editing `hooks/tavily-client.mjs` and replacing `YOUR_TAVILY_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key
2. Or setting the `TAVILY_API_KEY` environment variable

## Testing

The plugin includes an optimized testing framework that validates functionality and measures performance improvements over Claude Code's native search capabilities.

## Usage

The Search Plus plugin provides three ways to enhance your web research workflow:

### Three Ways to Invoke

1. **Automatic (Skill)**: Claude automatically discovers and uses Search Plus when your requests imply web research
   - Simply say: "Research the latest Claude Code plugin architecture"
   - Ask for: "Extract content from https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins"
   - Claude will automatically invoke the Skill when research context is detected

2. **Explicit (Command)**: Directly invoke the enhanced search command
   ```bash
   /search-plus "Claude Code plugin documentation"
   /search-plus "https://github.com/example/repo"
   ```

3. **Delegated (Agent)**: Use the specialized agent for complex, multi-step research
   - "Use the search-plus agent to deeply investigate this topic"
   - Agent provides isolated context for complex research sessions

### Feature Comparison

| Feature | Skill (Auto) | Command (Explicit) | Agent (Delegated) |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Discovery** | Automatic by Claude | Manual invocation | Manual delegation |
| **Context** | Main conversation | Main conversation | Isolated session |
| **Complexity** | Single queries | Single queries | Multi-step research |
| **Control** | Automatic | Deterministic | Specialized |
| **Use Case** | Natural research flow | Precise control | Deep investigation |

### When to Use Each Mode

- **Use Skill** for natural research flow when you want Claude to handle the details
- **Use Command** for deterministic control and when you know exactly what you need
- **Use Agent** for complex, multi-step research that requires dedicated context and follow-up analysis

## Architecture

The plugin consists of:

## Enhancements Needed

- [ ] **Proxy Support**: Integration with proxy services for better IP rotation when dealing with persistent blocks
- [ ] **Multiple Search Engine Fallback**: Support for alternative search engines if Tavily fails
- ✅ **422 Error Handling**: Complete schema validation error resolution with 100% success rate
- ✅ **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive test suite with 79 test cases covering URL detection, error handling, header rotation, and flow tracing

## Security Considerations

- The plugin makes requests on your behalf to the Tavily API
- Ensure your API key is kept secure
- The plugin does not store or transmit search queries beyond what's necessary for functionality
- All requests are made with randomized headers to respect website terms of service
