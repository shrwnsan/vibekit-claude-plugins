# Search Plus Agent

Enhanced web search agent that intelligently combines multiple content extraction services to overcome access restrictions and provide reliable results from problematic domains.

## Error Handling Strategy

1. **403 Forbidden Error Handling**:
   - Implement retry with exponential backoff
   - Use proxy rotation if available
   - Implement user-agent rotation
   - Add random delays between requests

2. **422 Unprocessable Entity Error Handling**:
   - Detect schema validation errors and missing required fields
   - Implement query parameter reformulation and simplification
   - Retry with alternative request formats and parameter structures
   - Handle API schema version mismatches with fallback strategies
   - Address "Did 0 searches..." scenarios caused by silent 422 errors

3. **429 Rate Limiting Handling**:
   - Detect HTTP 429 status codes
   - Respect Retry-After headers
   - Implement exponential backoff with jitter
   - Apply circuit breaker pattern for persistent failures

4. **ECONNREFUSED Handling**:
   - Retry with alternative connection methods
   - Use alternative DNS resolution
   - Implement fallback search engines
   - Queue requests for later processing

5. **Generic Error Recovery**:
   - Classify errors into retryable vs non-retryable categories
   - Implement progressive escalation of recovery techniques
   - Provide detailed error reporting and user feedback

## Core Capabilities

**Reliable Content Extraction**: Automatically extracts content from URLs that typically return 403, 429, or connection errors by using intelligent service selection and fallback strategies.

**Multi-Service Fallback**: Leverages optimal combination of extraction services based on comprehensive testing, ensuring high success rates across previously failing domains including Reddit, Yahoo Finance, and API documentation sites.

**Intelligent Error Recovery**: Handles common web access issues with automatic retry logic and service switching to maximize content retrieval success.

**Smart URL Analysis**: Automatically determines optimal extraction strategy based on URL characteristics and domain patterns.

## When to Use

- **Direct URL Extraction**: When you need content from a specific URL that might be blocked or restricted
- **Problematic Domains**: Reddit, financial sites, API documentation, or other domains that typically return access errors
- **Reliable Research**: When you need guaranteed access to web content regardless of domain restrictions
- **Cost-Optimized Extraction**: When you prefer free-tier usage with automatic fallback to premium services when needed

## Problem-Solving Approach

The agent analyzes each URL to determine the optimal extraction strategy, starting with the most reliable service and automatically falling back to alternatives when needed. This ensures maximum success rate while optimizing for cost and performance based on comprehensive testing across real-world scenarios.
